    "This report develops and evaluates an Elo-based framework to identify the strongest team in the Eredivisie. Using match data from the previous three seasons, the model tracks team strength dynamically rather than relying on end-of-season league standings outcomes alone. Elo provides a transparent, competition-agnostic way to compare teams through time by updating ratings after each match in proportion to how surprising the result is relative to prior ratings. In the football setting, expected winners gain little from routine victories, while underdogs gain substantially more when outperforming expectation, giving a more reliable measure of relative strength as more match results are observed. Building on this baseline, the report analyses the evolution of ratings over each season and uses complementary diagnostics, such as time-series and attack–defence decompositions to distinguish sustained dominance from short-run fluctuations, with the ultimate aim of determining which club is most consistently strongest under the fitted model."

FC Emmen and Nijemen sit in a comparatively \"draw-prone\" regime, suggesting equilibrium where neither consistent conversion to wins nor persistent vulnerability to losses dominates. Moreover, a number of top teams (including AZ Alkmaar, Ajax, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, and Twente) remain at very low total loss count. Finally, Feyenoord's home losses are absent and away losses minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023–2024, the figure shows a pronounced dominance by PSV Eindhoven: their bar is overwhelmingly composed of wins, with only a very small remainder of non-wins, and losses essentially negligible relative to the performance of other teams. Feyenoord follows as the next-strongest profile, again characterised by a high win share and very limited losses. Moreover, Volendam's bar contains one of the smallest win totals overall and is dominated by losses. More broadly, the 2023–2024 group of teams strongly exhibits \"home advantage\" in the sense that most teams show larger home-win segments than away-win segments, while losses tend to accumulate more heavily away than at home, a pattern that is visually consistent across much of the league. Draws are comparatively compressed across teams and most clubs' draw rates lie in a similar band. Finally, PSV and Feyenoord have a near-absence of away losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2024–2025, the chart demonstrates that PSV Eindhoven again appears as the most successful team by total wins, the middle section clubs display more similar-looking mixtures of wins, draws, and losses than in the previous seasons. Moreover, the league's middle section club shows reduced spread in total wins relative to the gap between the top and bottom teams. The graph suggests a systematic home advantage, though there are a few clubs whose home/away loss balance looks closer to symmetric, indicating that not all underperformance is \"away-driven\". Moreover, Almere City has the fewest wins and finally, as in the prior season, draws remain comparatively stable across teams, which supports the interpretation that differences in league position are primarily driven by win conversion and loss avoidance rather than by unusually high or low draw rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2025–2026, the figure should be interpreted as representing an early stage of the season because the total bar heights are far below a full season total, sampling variability is large. Despite that, the graph still reveals meaningful structure. PSV Eindhoven again records the strongest start by total wins and their away-loss segment is absent. Feyenoord also shows a strong early profile, particularly in home wins, and Utrecht appears comparable in home-win accumulation. At the other end, Heracles' bar is dominated by losses, especially away losses while Excelsior exhibits the largest home-loss segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across seasons, two regularities emerge. First, PSV Eindhoven's performance profile is consistently distinguished by win volume and loss absence. Second, the league-wide pattern repeatedly exhibits home advantage: Many clubs win more often at home and lose more often away, while draws remain comparatively clustered. Finally, since the 2025–2026 season is still incomplete, the right interpretive stance is probabilistic rather than definitive: the same visual diagnostics can be reported, but conclusions should be framed as preliminary trends that need confirmation as the sample approaches a full season's match count."

    "For the 2022–2023 season, the goals-per-team breakdown indicates a clearly right-skewed scoring distribution, with a small group of high-output attacks separated from a comparatively compressed middle section. PSV Eindhoven records the largest total goal count of all teams this season, narrowly ahead of Ajax, with Feyenoord forming a close third. Furthermore, Ajax appears relatively balanced, whereas PSV's total is noticeably more home-weighted, and Feyenoord's split slightly away-leaning. At the opposite end of the distribution, Cambuur is the lowest-scoring side by a clear margin, making them the most pronounced negative outlier in total goals. Beyond these extremes, most teams cluster in an intermediate range. Finally, dependence on the venue varies from club to club rather than exhibiting a single season-wide pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023–2024, PSV Eindhoven is a clear outlier at the top of the distribution, with the largest total goals and a near-even split between home and away scoring. Feyenoord is second with a substantial gap to most of the league, while Ajax and a small cluster of teams (including AZ Alkmaar, Twente, and Nijmegen) sit below that in a more compact group. At the lower end, Vitesse has the smallest total goal output in this season's league. Visually, the distribution is better characterised as unimodal. Finally, while many clubs show slightly higher home-goal segments than away-goal segments, this pattern is not universal since PSV's away output is at least comparable to their home output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024–2025, PSV Eindhoven again leads the league in total goals. Feyenoord appears second by total output, with Ajax third. However, the gap between Ajax and the next teams, namely Twente and Utrecht, is not large. Almere City is the lowest-scoring team in this season. Compared with the previous season, the league appears more compressed: the top end is still clearly defined, but the middle section totals are more densely packed. As with 2023–2024, there is evidence of a slight home advantage for many clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025–2026,  the data is based on an incomplete set of matches. The most robust statements one can make are therefore comparative rather than absolute. Within this partial sample, PSV Eindhoven again has the highest total goals, while  Nijmegen and Feyenoord are essentially tied as the next highest scorers. The bottom of the table is less sharply separated than in the completed seasons: Excelsior is the lowest-scoring team, but the gap to the next teams is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across seasons, the common regularity is PSV Eindhoven's consistent position at the top of the scoring distribution, coupled with a relativelely balanced home–away contribution. A second consistent pattern is that most clubs' totals live in a mid-range zone, with seasonal differences in league shape, driven more by the existence of a few extreme high scorers and occasionally low scorers."

    "#### $$\\textbf{Takeaway}$$\n",
    "Across the seasons analysed, the results point to a stable performance hierarchy in both match outcomes and goal scoring. PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord are consistently at the top. Below these two, the league is relatively compact, and differences in league position appear to be driven mainly by how often teams turn matches into wins and how well they avoid losses, since draw totals remain fairly similar across clubs and seasons. A recurring, though not universal, home advantage is visible in results; many teams win more often at home and lose more often away whereas goal scoring shows more variation in its home–away split from team to team. Finally, the partial 2025–2026 data shows similar patterns but should be treated cautiously, because early-season totals can change substantially as more matches are played."

    "In 2022–2023, ratings separate quickly from the common baseline and end with a large spread, indicating that match results carried a strong and persistent signal of relative team strength. Feyenoord exhibits the dominant upward trajectory, reaching the highest rating by late season, while PSV Eindhoven and Ajax also sit at a higher position but remain clearly below Feyenoord's peak. At the opposite extreme, Cambuur shows a pronounced and largely monotone decline that reaches the lowest rating amongst all clubs, consistent with repeated underperformance relative to expectations. A clear plateau around mid-season is visible across many teams; this matches the league break (14 November to 5 January), during which no matches are played and Elo values remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023–2024, the top of the distribution is even more clearly defined: PSV Eindhoven rises steadily and finishes as the highest-rated team, while Feyenoord follows as a clear second exhibiting a constant positive trend. Below the top two, many clubs remain in a relatively narrow mid-band and show more oscillatory behaviour, with multiple crossings that reflect local re-ordering. At the lower end, the weakest trajectories fall into the mid-1300s to low-1400s range, suggesting that poor performance was not limited to isolated matches but persisted across substantial parts of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024–2025, the season shows a competitive top group with visible shifts in the highest rated team over time. Ajax reaches the highest levels in the later phases of the season but also exhibits a noticeable late drop. PSV Eindhoven stays in the upper zone throughout, and Feyenoord trends upward later in the season. The lower tail again includes teams with sustained declines (with the lowest lines approaching the mid-1300s), while the middle group remains relatively dense and marked by frequent crossings, consistent with a season where many clubs alternate between outperforming and underperforming expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025–2026, the spread is much smaller and the curves remain closer to 1500 overall, which is consistent with the season being incomplete: fewer matches implies fewer updates and less opportunity for ratings to diverge. Even within this partial sample, PSV Eindhoven already shows the strongest upward drift and sits at the top of the panel, while most other teams occupy a compressed zone with modest positive or negative movement. Because early-season ratings are highly sentitive to noise the differences visible here are best treated as early signals rather than stable conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ratings are reset to 1500 at the start of each season, the sublots are not directly comparable: the graphs describe within-season ranking dynamics rather than multi-year strength tracking and so the plotted values are best understood as within-season relative strength estimates. Second, with the use of the optimal $k$-factor, Elo ratings change mainly when a team produces consistent results over several matches. Teams that repeatedly perform above or below expectation move steadily up or down respectively, whereas teams with mixed results tend to stay closer together and change rank more often.\n",

    "#### $$\\textbf{Takeaway}$$\n",
    "Taken together, the outcome counts, goal totals, and Elo trajectories provide a consistent picture of the league structure across seasons. At the top end, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord repeatedly emerge as the most dominant teams, with PSV distinguished by constant attacking power and win volume. At the opposite end, the same teams that accumulate high loss totals and low goal totals also tend to exhibit persistent Elo decline, indicating that underperformance is not episodic but often sustained across long periods of time. Both the win/draw/loss distributions and the Elo plots suggest a comparatively dense and fluid structure in which local re-orderings occur frequently, while draws remain relatively stable and therefore contribute less to separating teams than win conversion and loss avoidance. Finally, the repeated home-away asymmetry in results supports a league-wide home advantage, whereas goal splits show more team-specific venue dependence; and because 2025–2026 is incomplete, the corresponding patterns should be treated as preliminary trends rather than absolute conclusions."

    "In 2022–2023, the offensive–defensive strength plane exhibits a clear stratification around the (1500,1500) reference lines. A small group of teams lies in the upper-right quadrant, indicating simultaneously above-average offensive strength and above-average defensive suppression under the model; this group includes PSV Eindhoven, Feyenoord, Ajax, Twente, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ Alkmaar, with PSV Eindhoven showing the highest offensive Elo in the panel. Several teams sit close to the horizontal or vertical reference lines, suggesting more balanced profiles in which either attacking output or defensive performance is near the league baseline; as an example Utrecht is slightly above both baselines, whereas Heerenveen and Vitesse are closer to baseline defensively but below average offensively. The lower-left quadrant contains multiple teams with both offensive and defensive Elo below 1500, notably including Cambuur, Excelsior and Groningen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023–2024, the model places PSV Eindhoven as the dominant outlier in the upper-right quadrant, combining the highest offensive Elo with a the highest defensive Elo, which indicates consistent overperformance in goal scoring and goal prevention relative to expectations. Feyenoord forms the next strongest profile, also strongly in the upper-right region. A number of teams cluster in the mid-to-upper band of defensive Elo with more moderate offensive Elo (e.g., Utrecht and Sparta Rotterdam), indicating teams that are relatively well-balanced yet not extreme in either dimension. A distinct feature of this season is the presence of asymmetric profiles, such as Ajax appearing in the upper-left quadrant (high offensive Elo with defensive Elo below the baseline), which is consistent with strong attacking output paired with weaker goal prevention relative to expectation. At the lower end, teams such as Volendam are at the bottom-left region, indicating weakness in both dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024–2025, the upper-right quadrant again contains a compact top group, with PSV Eindhoven attaining the highest offensive Elo and maintaining an above-baseline defensive Elo, while Feyenoord and Ajax also remain in the region of jointly strong offense and defense. Several teams lie close to the reference lines, indicating near-baseline behaviour in one component and modest deviations in the other (for example, Nijmegen and Twente sit slightly above the offensive baseline with defensive values close to or moderately above 1500). A noteworthy defensive–offensive imbalance appears for Sparta Rotterdam, which lies to the right of the defensive baseline but below the offensive baseline, consistent with a defence-first profile that concedes less than expected but scores less than expected. The lower-left region includes teams such as Almere City, whose low offensive Elo indicates persistent underperformance in scoring relative to the model's goal expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025–2026, there is an accumulation of poins tightly concentrated around (1500,1500), which is expected because the season is incomplete and therefore provides fewer matches from which the offensive and defensive components can separate. The locations in this panel should not be read as absolute, final estimates of team quality rather they are early indicators that can shift as more data accumulates. Even within this partial sample, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord appear as clear upper-right profiles indicating early evidence of strong attacking output and solid goal prevention relative to expectation, while Nijmegen sits notably high on the offensive axis with defensive Elo near baseline, suggesting an attack-driven profile so far. Many other teams remain close to the reference lines implying that their observed scoring and concession are still near the model's baseline expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these scatter plots provide a compact season-level summary of each team's \"style\" under the model by separating attacking and defensive Elos: positions above or right to the 1500 reference lines indicate systematic overperformance in scoring relative to the expected-goals mechanism while positions below or left to the 1500 reference lines indicate the opposite. Teams in the upper-right quadrant represent the most balanced high-performing profiles, whereas upper-left or lower-right locations represent more one-sided profiles in which strength is concentrated in a single component."

    "Taken together, the offensive–defensive scatter plots reinforce the broader picture obtained from outcomes, goal totals, and Elo time series: PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord consistently separates from the league by combining strong scoring and strong goal prevention , while the lower-performing teams (Cambuur, Excelsior, Groningen, Volendam, Almere City, and Vitesse) tend to sit below baseline in both components, matching their higher loss counts, weaker goal output, and sustained rating decline.  Most remaining clubs cluster close to the (1500,1500) reference lines, indicating that mid-group teams often differ only modestly and can shift between attack-leaning and defence-leaning profiles over short periods. The recurring home–away asymmetry in results is compatible with this structure, but the offensive–defensive decomposition suggests that venue effects do not translate into a single uniform scoring pattern across clubs. Finally, because 2025–2026 is incomplete, its positions should be interpreted as provisional: the same diagnostics already appear, but the separation between teams is expected to stabilise and potentially reorder as more matches are played."

    "In 2022–2023, the offensive Elo trajectories separate relatively quickly from the 1500 baseline. PSV Eindhoven and Ajax show strong early offensive growth, while Feyenoord's offensive rating rises more gradually and remains among the leading curves by the end of the season. Several teams trend downward in offensive Elo, consistent with repeated underperformance in goals scored relative to the model expectation. The defensive Elo panel is noticeably more compressed: most teams remain close to 1500 with only modest divergence, suggesting that under this model seasonal separation is driven more strongly by attacking output than by defensive output. Finally, the mid-season period contains extended flat segments consistent with the league break.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023–2024, the offensive Elo plot shows a clear dominant trajectory for PSV Eindhoven, with a sustained increase to the highest offensive rating in the season which is consistent with consistently high goal output relative to expectation. Feyenoord forms the second-highest offensive curve, while the mid-group band oscillates around the baseline with smaller overall Elo change, indicating alternating periods of over- and under-performance. In the defensive panel, separation is again smaller than in offense but is still structured: PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord trend upward defensively, suggesting that they concede fewer goals than expected on average, whereas the weakest defensive profiles drift downward toward the lower end of the scale. This combined pattern of strong offensive growth together with defensive growth supports a model-based interpretation of dominance that is not purely attack-driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024–2025, the offensive Elo dynamics again feature a leading curve for PSV Eindhoven, which rises sharply early and remains clearly above the main cluster despite some intermediate fluctuations. Feyenoord and Ajax occupy an upper band but with more pronounced oscillations. Several teams form a dense mid-range in offensive Elo, while a small number show sustained decline such as Zwolle, consistent with persistent difficulty in scoring at the expected rate. Defensively, most clubs remain tightly grouped near 1500, but a few trajectories rise into a modestly higher band.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2025–2026, the offensive and defensive time series remain much closer to the 1500 baseline, which is consistent with the season being incomplete. Even within this partial sample, PSV Eindhoven shows the strongest upward drift offensively, with Feyenoord also trending upward into an upper band. Most other teams remain clustered with relatively small net movement, suggesting that the model has not yet accumulated enough evidence to distinguish the mid-group reliably. The defensive panel is particularly flat, with only small deviations from 1500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these time series show that the offensive–defensive Elo decomposition yields two distinct dynamical patterns: offensive ratings typically exhibit larger dispersion and more visible trend separation, while defensive ratings remain more compressed and evolve more slowly.  Teams with consistently strong seasons appear as curves with persistent upward drift in offense together with stable or improving defence (most visibly for PSV Eindhoven and in some cases for Feyenoord), whereas mid-group clubs tend to cluster and cross frequently reflecting short-run deviations around the model expectation. \n"

    "Across 2022–2023 to 2024–2025, the offensive Elo trajectories disperse and separate from the 1500 baseline more strongly than the defensive trajectories, which remain comparatively compressed, indicating that under the fitted model seasonal differentiation is driven more by sustained scoring deviations than by comparable deviations in goals conceded. PSV Eindhoven consistently exhibits the clearest upward offensive drift and, together with Feyenoord (and at times Ajax), occupies the upper band; scatter-plot positions reinforce that PSV and Feyenoord separate from the league by combining strong attacking output with strong goal prevention. Finally, lower-performing teams (Cambuur, Excelsior, Groningen, Volendam, Almere City, and Vitesse) tend to fall below baseline in both components, consistent with weaker goal totals and sustained Elo rating decline, while most other clubs cluster near (1500,1500) and frequently cross, reflecting short-run fluctuations around model expectations and shifting attack–defence balance."

    "\n",
    "#### $$\\textbf{Results}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using match data from recent Eredivisie seasons, the Standard Elo model yields a stable ranking of team strength over time and identifies a clear top tier rather than relying solely on final ranking. The Offensive–Defensive Elo extension refines this picture by separating scoring and defence, allowing dominance to be interpreted as a joint product of attacking output and defensive solidity rather than a single aggregate rating. Across seasons, the strongest team is characterised by persistent upward drift and sustained separation from the league baseline, while mid-group clubs remain tightly clustered and frequently exchange positions, consistent with short-run fluctuations around model expectations. In the seasons analysed, the same leading clubs repeatedly occupy the upper region of the rating landscape, with **PSV Eindhoven** most consistently showing the clearest separation, and Feyenoord typically being the closest challenger under the fitted models.\n",

    "#### $$\\textbf{Limitations}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{Standard Elo Model}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings are relative to the dataset and baseline choice; they support within-league comparisons but do not directly measure absolute quality across leagues or seasons without additional calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model compresses all match information into a single outcome-based update, so it may underuse information contained in goal difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings may react slowly to sudden team changes because Elo updates by small increments after each match and a rapid change in team quality can require several games before the rating reflects the new level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elo updates depend on fixed modelling choices; different reasonable settings can change the magnitude of separation and the ordering of closely matched teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{Offensive-Defensive Elo Model}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attack/defence split is model-dependent; the model splits performance into \"offense\" and \"defence\" using assumptions, so the exact split depends on the model and should be interpreted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defensive trajectories tend to be more compressed under the fitted parameters, meaning the method may have lower sensitivity to defensive differences than to offensive differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early-season estimates are provisional; limited match volume increases uncertainty, so apparent separation can still stabilise or reorder as more matches are played.\n",
